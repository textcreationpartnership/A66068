         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt. To know the Points uſed in Print:<note place="margin">1 Leſſon.</note> which are theſe Seven.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) A Comma. It's a Point at end of a Short Part of a Sentence, without Perfect Senſe. And it's a note of ſome little Pauſe, Stop, or Breathing in Reading. It's marked Thus,</item>
               <item>(2) A Semicolon. It's a Pauſe a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a Comma. It's marked Thus;</item>
               <item>(3) A Colon. It's a longer Pauſe than the former: and its a part of a Sentence that makes Senſe without the Full Sentence yet ſo as the reſt is expected to compleat it. It's marked Thus:</item>
               <item>(4) A Period. It's a full perfect Point, put at
<pb facs="tcp:106434:3"/>end of a compleat Sentence. It's marked Thus. Obſerve the Senſe contained in a Sentence, or you Read Confuſion.</item>
               <item>(5) A note of Exclamation, or Admiration. It's put at end of an Expreſſion uttered by way of Out-cry, or Wonder. It's marked Thus! As <hi>[O how lofty are their eyes!</hi>

               <item>(7) Parentheſis. It's a Clauſe included, or ſhut in with two Semicircles, or half Moons: though it give ſome Strength to a Sentence, yet if left out the Senſe remains Sound. It's marked Thus () As <hi>[Let me (I pray thee) drink a little water of thy pitcher.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 24.17.</note>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Second. To know where the Emphaſis layeth in a Sentence. Emphaſis is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Mind, by a Word expreſſed with ſome Earneſtneſs, or Force. This Word I begin with a Capital, or Great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here note words which muſt alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Capitals.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) The firſt Word of every Sentence.<note place="margin">Pro. 9.10.</note> As <hi>[The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom]</hi> So if the Sentence begin with a Single Letter.<note place="margin">Pro. 1.5.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Deu. 32.29.</note> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>(2) The firſt Word of the Saying of an Other, Related: though it do not begin a
<pb facs="tcp:106434:3"/>Sentence. As,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.46.</note> The officers anſwered <hi>[Never man ſpake like this man]</hi> And many of them ſaid <hi>[He hath a Devil,</hi>

               </item>
               <item>(3) The firſt Word, or Letter of every Verſe, or Line in Poety. As,
<q>
                     <l>A man without learning, <hi>Cato</hi> doth ſay:</l>
                     <l>May be compared to an Image of Clay.</l>
                  </q>
               </item>
               <item>(4) Proper Names. (1) Of God, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>] Of Chriſt, as, <hi>Jeſus</hi>] Of an Angel, as, <hi>Gabriel</hi>] Of Men and Women, as, <hi>Adam, Abel, Daniel, Dorcas</hi>] Of Countries, as, <hi>Aſia, England, Spain</hi>] Of Cities, as, <hi>London, Jeruſalem</hi>] Of Towns, as, <hi>Barnet, Bethany</hi>] Of Places, or Hills, as, <hi>Eden, Sinai</hi>] Of Rivers, as, <hi>Thames, Jordan, Cedron</hi>] Of Months, as, <hi>Jan, Feb, Abib</hi>] Of the four Winds, as, <hi>Eaſt, W, N, S.</hi>] Proper Names I put in Italian Different Letters: and ſo to put other Names is Improper.</item>
               <item>(5) Appellatives or Common Names: which are common to all of that Kind. (1) Of People, as, Jew, Hebrew, Gentile, Heathen, Chriſtian, Proteſtant, Papiſt, Pagan, Indian] Names of Arts, as, Printer, Painter, Mercer, Grocer] Of Dignity, as, Emperour, King, Q, Prince, Pope, Duke] Of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as, Ambaſſador, Prieſt, Prophet, Paſtour, Apoſtle, Elder, Deacon, Judge, General, Captain] Of Dayes, as, Sabbath] Of Spirits,
<pb facs="tcp:106434:4"/>as, Angel, Cherub, Seraphim, Devil, Satan] Note [god] if a falſe god, muſt begin with a ſmall letter. But the true [God] with a Capital. And, Father, Son, Spirit: Lord, Chriſt, Ghoſt] when they Signifie the True God, or the Perſons in the Holy Trinity] To which I adde Names of Books (ſo many as are not Proper Names of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) as, Gen, Exod] And of Tongues, as, Hebrew, Greek, Latine, Engliſh] Moſt of theſe Names, Proper, and Appellative, ſtand Thin in this Book. In all theſe Words which always begin with Capitals, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis ſeldom layeth: when it doth, I put that Word all in Capitals that you know it at eaſe. When an other Word is all in Capitals, it ſignifies the Greater Emphaſis.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now for Emphatical Words. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis is tied to no Word whatever. It is ſometime in a Subſtantial Word. Sometime in two or three ſuch words together. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a ſmall Word, as [be, do, ſo, no, to, at, of, off, on, in, out] as, <hi>[I will No more have mercy on the houſe of Iſrael.]</hi> In other place [no] hath no Emphaſis, as,<note place="margin">Pro. 3.30.</note> 
               <hi>[Strive not with a man if he have done thee [no] harm]</hi> In other place it's in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial word Mercy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 15 22</note> as, <hi>[Have Mercy on me O Lord]</hi> As when Sea-men are Sinking with this cry, Mercy! Mercy! There is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis. In other place (by reaſon of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:106434:4"/>Emphaticalneſs of the Expreſſion) you may put it in This or That Word as you Will, as, [I Will ſurely have mercy] I will Surely have mercy] <hi>I will ſurely have Mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord]</hi> Sometime the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20.</note> Is, and is Not in the Same Word,<note place="margin">Pro. 31.2.</note> in the Same Sentence: as, [What my Son! and what the ſon of my Womb!] To miſplace it makes it give an unpleaſant ſenſeleſs ſound: as, what the Son of my womb] It's in Vain to put Force upon a Wrong Word: it's like a Stroke at a Wooden Bell.</p>
            <p>Theſe Emphatical Words obſerved, will help you to underſtand the Senſe. And if beſides the Words which conſtantly begin with Capitals, there Be ever a Capital that is not Emphatical: yet it's Subſtantial, and ſerves to ſhew the Senſe, as all Emphatical Words do. Emphatical Words begun with Capitals, avoids that Hodge Podge they make, who put Half their Words in Different Letters.</p>
            <p>Third. To underſtand Abbreviation,<note place="margin">3 Leſſon.</note> or Shortning of Words: which for Brevity Sake is uſed in Books. Some of them are the Firſt Letters of Latine Words; which many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors uſe, but Explain not for their Engliſh Reader. The moſt Neceſſary (of all which) to know are Theſe.</p>
            <p>&amp;c <hi>et caetera</hi>] and the reſt [or] and ſo forth.</p>

This is a MAD TRADE.<note place="margin">An ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> ¶ 7) Where Tabacco hath got the Maſtery, it is a great Enemy.

And he that is under this Slavery, is not at Liberty, to order either Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Soul, as he ſhould. Nor does he ſeem to Care, what becomes of one, or the other.

But they uſually returned with this anſwer [We cannot come at him, for he conſtantly prayes to God.] At length he (being in Haſt) went out one morning without prayer. And that day they did him a greater miſchief than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s Devils did him in the Lions Den: viz,

The M L on <hi>Adam</hi>'s Heart.</note> The Moral Law, Decalogue, or Ten Commandments was engraven on <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart, as a Primitive Perfect Law of Nature. <hi>Adam</hi> being created in God's Image, which conſiſteth in Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe, had the Law written in his Heart, the Sum of which is Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe. And <hi>Adam</hi> being capable of it, God entred into a C W with him which contained (1) A peremptory precept, [Do this:] (2) A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſe, [If thou Do, thou ſhalt Live:] (3) A conditional threat, [If thou Do not, thou ſhalt Die.] To keep this C W for Life, no man was ever able: except (1) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> who brake it and ruined All mankind: and (2) <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> who by his obedience to it hath recovered all the Elect. But though no man can keep it, yet Every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever is under it: and to Them it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Condemnation<note n="†" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.9</note>.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106434:79"/>in mans ſtead to Die for him: by vertue of which Death, beleeving man hath Life and Favour with God. And that for 2000 years (and more) from the Fall to the delivery of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> the Subſtance of their Religion was the Same, as after the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick promulgation of the Law.

N B, Man is to be conſidered in a twofold State, precedent to a State of Grace. (1) In innocency.] In this State the law as a C W, was mans rule Of life, and For life: ſo long as he Obeyed he lived. (2) In a Fallen ſtate.] The condition of the C W was ſuch, that the Leaſt ſin Brake it: and brought man under the Curſe of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin man was under the Bleſſing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: after ſin man was under the Curſe of the C W: and this is the Caſe of all Carnal men. In this State the M L is a rule of Moral Life. And the more exactly (to his light) a Moral man is ruled by it, the more he is to be Commended: though thereby he is not Juſtified. And it is (in a Senſe) a rule, To life eternal: i e, as it is a School-maſter to direct to Chriſt to be Juſtified by Faith. And this it doth Occaſionally, by ſhewing Sin and Wrath: without a ſight of which, what cares a Sinner for a Saviour. God likeneth his Law to a Looking-glaſſe<note n="†" place="margin">

                     <p>There is a threefold killing by the law. (1) By applying the Curſe to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, and leaving him under it in deſpair. (2) By condemning a Preciſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for his imperfect obedience. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are killed, and yet ſecure: but they will find themſelves killed at Laſt, let them do their Beſt. Thus the Law is a Miniſtry of death. (3) To kill ſelf-confidence, in ſelf-righteouſneſſe. To make a Sinner ſenſible of the ſentence of Condemnation he is under: as one dead in Law,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> at ſtake to be Burned, at pits brink to be damned: ſo as to be ſet a ſeeking life by Free Grace.

                     <p>Now you talk of ſuch hearers, and put it into my head, I tell you, here are ſuch
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106434:111"/>Parcels as I could not have believed to be in <hi>London,</hi> had I not heard and ſeen it. eg,</p>
                     <p>¶ 1) Some are pleaſed with their pure go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,<note place="margin">1 Sort of ſimple hearers.</note> without Law or Duty: with faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works. Let a Miniſter tell them a ſtory of Chriſt's benefits, &amp;c, they think All is their own. Poor deluded creatures! where is their Faith? they muſt ſhew it by their Works, if God may be Judge<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ja.</hi> 2.18.</note>. If their goſpel Miniſter ſhould preach duty ſo neceſſary, and preſſe the power of godlineſſe; they would leave him for a Legal preacher: not enduring ſuch ſound Doctrine, for want of ſound Hearts.</p>
                     <p>¶ 2) Other judge of a Miniſter,<note place="margin">2 Sort.</note> by the multitude of his auditors: being albe to give no other account of him, than he who haſteth to ſome Hurly-burly or Tumult in the Street: viz, he runs becauſe he ſees others run before him. If this be a rule to judge a Miniſter by, we may cry up the Quakers, and other who are unſound in Fundamentals: for ſuch have the great Aſſernablies.</p>
                     <p>¶ 3) Other are taken with Tones,<note place="margin">3 Sort.</note> and Accents: as if the life and power of Preaching lay in Points, and Tittles: for if a Sermon be Subſtantial, yet if not Tonical, its to them a Toy. Or, let the ſame ſounding Sermon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered without Tone, or Read to them, its not worth a Ruſh.</p>
                     <p>¶ 4) Other admire a Miniſter,<note place="margin">4 Sort.</note> who hath a ſtrange kind of confidence with God: though
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106434:111"/>his boldneſſe be a fruit of his ignorance. And admire his out cryes againſt the enemy: and the broad ſides he give them out of his pulpit, prophetically pulling them down before their time: though this be a fruit of a 3-fold igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. (1) Of the enemies power, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, rather than knowledge of Gods power and wiſdom to oppoſe them. (2) Ignorance of <hi>Englands</hi> Sins: for which God may juſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Antichriſt to make the Nations Shake at the ſound of our fall, before he comes down. (3) Ignorance of their own duty, to ſtay God's time: <hi>wait ye upon Me, ſaith the Lord, untill the day that I riſe up to the pray</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Zepb.</hi> 3.8.</note> Yet is this kind of confidence admired: and if a preacher be Sober, and do not Hector and Vapour, his Sermon is ſnuffed at as a Cypher.</p>
                     <p>¶ 5) Other are in love with a loud noiſe:<note place="margin">5 Sort.</note> they like him beſt who ſpeaks Loudeſt: though he deſreve to be told as one told the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale in eating its little carkaſe, <hi>Vox tu es pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea nihil,</hi> thou art nothing but noiſe.] It is not the Sermon, but the Sound, that is Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant to ſuch. If the ſame Sermon, or a much better, be delivered with a low voice, though a ſubſtantial, ſound, ſuitable Sermon, and preached in Print, its not worth a Pin. I do not know but a Drum in a Pulpit, is as good for them as good Doctrine. Call them to an account of their Canorous preachers proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they reply, O he is a Thundering preacher!
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106434:112"/>he hath a Rouſing voice! ſo it ſeems, if a man have but bare Brains, and ſtrong Lungs, its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though that be all.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Such hearers are like the Servant who came home crying up the Sermon to the Clouds: to whom ſaid his Mr, What was the Text? <hi>Sir it was taken out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came in.</hi> What of the application of the Sermon? <hi>I came out before he had done.</hi> What of the middle of the Sermon? <hi>Sir, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep then.</hi> I will trouble you but with one ſort more, and they are</p>
                     <p>¶ 6) A company of Children,<note place="margin">6 Sort.</note> who chooſe to hear Youths preach.

                  <p>A THIRD DIALOGUE Concerning the SABBATH-DAY.</p>

                  <q>Then I contended with the Nobles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and prophane the Sabbath-Day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this City? yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael by prophaning the Sabbath. <bibl>Neh. <hi>13.17, 18.</hi>

It hath been a Sad time with me ſince we ſat under the Tree: though I concealed it from you in our laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. SAD! I have Reaſon to be Sad indeed, to think how ſadly I have neglected my poor children Souls. O to think how many times we have walked by the way, and not a word of God! to think how many times they have been twatling about me in the houſe, and not a word! how many times they have been pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bed, and pulled out, and not a Word of God have I ſpoken for their good! O it hath cut me to the quick! and put me upon prayer for pardon, ſpace, and grace to do my duty. And I did addict my ſelf to it: and began to find peace in it. But yeſterday after the afternoon Sermon, as I was inſtructing my children about the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Parents complaint of Mr <hi>S</hi> Mr <hi>A</hi> Mr <hi>L.</hi>
                        </note> in came Mr <hi>S</hi> in anger, and told me, I kept the wrong day: and ſaid, I ſhould keep the Seventh day, firſt appointed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reprealed. When he was gone, Mr <hi>A</hi> came in and Laughed at me, and my practice as a low thing: viz, to keep One day in a week: and told me, I ſhould keep Every day as He did. When he was gone, Mr <hi>L</hi> came in and told me, I ſhould keep Never a day Sabbath: for that command for a Sabbath was Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and long ſince ceaſed at Chriſt's death.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106434:115"/>And my Children liſtened to this laſt with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: and now they ſlight the Sabbath, and whatever I ſay for it: and tell me Mr <hi>L</hi> is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wiſe man. And under this Sorrow upon Sorrow I am ſo diſquieted I am almoſt diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. In your laſt conference, at end of the Tenth Note, when you preſſed it upon me to learn my Children to reverence the Sabbath; I had a mind to ask you what Scripture proof we have for the change of the Day: but I was loth to interrupt you: but now being driven out in diſtreſſe, I pray let me hear your reply to all theſe Opinions, but chiefly for the change of the Sabbath Day.</p>

                           <hi>Lu.</hi> 8.12.</note>. Indeed you are to be pitied, and ſo are they: but I fear ſome of them will be plagued. As for your former Sorrow, its Alway <hi>better than laughter</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Ecl. 7.3.</note>, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times better than joy: there is ſorrow that Dries the ſpirit, this will Water it: and ſo I praiſe God for it, and paſſe it. But this Laſt is the Peſt, that carries the Poyſon in it: for which I muſt provide ſome Antidote to expell it. As for my reply to theſe perſons, Mr <hi>A</hi> who keeps every day Sabbath, and Mr <hi>L</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:106434:116"/>who keeps never a day Sabbath;<note place="margin">Every day Never a day.</note> you may put them together (for he that keeps Every day keeps Never a day) and ſo look on them as two perſons poſſeſſed by Satan: above the dominion of God, and under the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Devil. But let us take them aſunder again: and ſpeak to them apart.</p>
                     <p>¶ 1) This Every day Sabbath is none of God's ordinance,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>A</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted.</note> for God's command is, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Exo. 20.9.</note>: it muſt therefore be the Devils ordinance, and to him its obſerved: as the Prieſts which God did not appoint, are ſaid to be ordained <hi>for the Devils</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chro. 11 15.</note>. Mr <hi>A</hi> is blown up into the Air with a blaſt from the bottomleſſe pit, and puft up with Pride: a Sabbath day a week is a weak thing with him: he is a 7-fold Saint or under a 7-fold Deceit, in the border of Heaven, whence he is like to fall into the belly of Hell.</p>
                     <p>¶<note n="2)" place="margin">Mr <hi>L</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted.</note> Mr <hi>L</hi> who keeps Never a day Sabbath, but ſlights the Sabbath as Ceremonial, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, (1) The Sabbath was not given firſt to the Jews or ſeed of <hi>Abram,</hi> as Ceremonies were:<note place="margin">Sabbath was made for Man.</note> but it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a Publick perſon, for him and his poſterity, to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether man ſtood or fell: and this in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency before Ceremonies were in uſe. And though <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſubject to wearineſſe before ſin, yet a Sabbath was ſuitable for him, as a Sacred ceſſation from his calling. So God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a Sabbath, and <hi>Bleſſed it:</hi> i e, to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106434:116"/>make it a bleſſing to him that kept it: <hi>and Sanctified it</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 2.3</note>, i e, he ſet it apart for holy uſe. (2) The Sabbath was Certainly obſerved, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Law on <hi>Sinai,</hi> though not much expreſſed in Geneſis, which is but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort Epitomy of 2000 years Acts, in which time many excellent acts were done, which are omitted, and not recorded. <hi>Abrahams</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath day, is without diſpute: becauſe he is ſo commended for keeping Gods commandments<note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 26.5.</note>. And that the Sabbath was known to Iſrael before <hi>Sinai,</hi> you may See<note n="†" place="margin">Exo. 16.23.</note>: the breach of which command is counted as the breach of all<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 28.</note>. (3) This command for a Sabbath is one of the Ten, delivered on <hi>Sinai</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ceremonies:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Sabbatical river that runs ſix dayes and reſts one will riſe up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Mr <hi>L</hi> and Mr <hi>A.</hi>
                        </note> and wrote on two tables of Stone, and put into the Ark, as no Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony ever was. Mr <hi>L</hi> playes the Papiſt, who takes away one, and leaves but nine. (4) Chriſts precept for Prayer, to prevent flight on the Sabbath, which flight was to be 40 years after Ceremonies ceaſed, proves the Sabbath no Ceremony: <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the Winter,</hi> q d, that will wrong your Bodies: <hi>neither on the Sabbath</hi>

Mr <hi>A</hi> and Mr <hi>L</hi> are brethren, both under a 7-fold deceit: to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them, let us put them together again to conſider, viz, God in wiſdom did ſo order the change of the Day, that though it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned two Sabbaths to come together, yet
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106434:117"/>there was not Two in a week, nor a week with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out One: to ſignifie, there muſt be nor more nor leſſe than One Sabbath in One Week.</p>

                     <p>As for Mr <hi>S</hi> who denies the change of the Day,<note place="margin">The chang of the Sabbath.</note> I ſay; Though the Change of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be not founded out with a Trumpet on <hi>Sinai</hi> as the Command of the Sabbath was; yet have we ſo much in Scripture as may Satisfie concerning it. They that ſay, Give me a plain precept for a practice, or I will not regard it; may mean Honeſtly, but they ſpeak Ignorantly. For if from a Text we can draw a direct, ſound Inference to prove a practice, that (being the Senſe of Scripture) is to be regarded as Scripture it ſelf. The ſenſe of Scripture we are to ſeek as Silver: and if this be not to be regarded, its vain to uſe any Scriptural Reaſon, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in diſcourſe as <hi>Paul</hi> uſed to do<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17.2. Ch. 18.4, 19. Ch. 24.25.</note>: or to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and expound the Scripture by preaching. Then put a Boy into a pulpit to read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for what other Sermon can an able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter make? if nothing but the very words of Scripture muſt be delivered. But let us ſee ſome Scriptural proof for this practice.</p>
                     <p>¶ 1) <hi>The ſtone the builders refuſed,</hi>

(2) On Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Bodies, who by the formidable hand of God, have been ſtruck Dead on this day in the very Act. (3) On Sabbath-breakers Souls, who have proudly pretended to keep every
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106434:119"/>day: ſuch have been (and are) commonly Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Blaſted, and with all their Blaze brought to nought. To which 1 adde 2 Queries for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and one Aſſertion for full ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>¶ 1) Was not the Fourth command for a Sabbath Day placed among (and one of) the Ten,<note place="margin">1 Q.</note> to ſignifie, it is Originally and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Moral and Perpetual? and ſometimes put among Ceremonial Sabbaths<note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 23.2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> to ſignifie, that in reſpect of that circumſtance of Time, it was Typical, and ſubject to change? viz, with reſpect to the Day.</p>
                     <p>¶ 2) Did not <hi>Adam</hi> fall on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day,<note place="margin">2 Q.</note> and ſo break the firſt Sabbath that ever was made? and if ſo, did not that ſignifie, the day was mutable? as the fall and breach of the Tables containing the C W with <hi>Adam</hi> ſignified the mutation of that Covenant, and the making of a New C from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>¶ A firſt day Sabbath is (in a Senſe) of as great Antiquity,<note place="margin">Aſſertion.</note> as the firſt Sabbath ordained for <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. Though that was at the end of Gods Works, it was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mans Life. God Ended his week with a Sabbath: but man Began his week with a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. It ſeems he was made at end of the Sixth day, to begin his life on the Seventh day, which was his Firſt day, though he was made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the day began. <hi>Adam</hi> was a Type of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who began his New Life at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with a Sabbath, the firſt day of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106434:120"/>week. And ſo muſt we begin our week with a Sabbath: a day for God Firſt, which is Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more acceptable to God, than to ſerve our ſelves Six dayes firſt, and then put off God (bleſſed for ever) with an Od day at laſt. So much for the change of the Sabbath Day.</p>

                     <p>I need not inſtance every hour of the day,<note place="margin">The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath.</note> but onely the time contended for: viz, Morning, Noon, Even, Midnight: and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the day, viz, 12 hours, and 24 hours.</p>
                     <p>¶ 1) I need not deny that it begins at [Noon] (as the Gipſies count) as if that time was contended for in <hi>England:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Not at Noon.</note> but though it be not the Plea, it is the Practice of ſome profeſſors, who begin to aſſemble in Gods ſervice after noon, as it were by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to ſerve God by the halves.

                        <note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 16.3.</note>: which ſay ſuch was a Type of Chriſts riſing at midnight.] <hi>Samſon</hi> was a Type of Chriſt in 20 things: but that he was a Type of Chriſts death and reſurrection, in laying a piece of a night upon pleaſure, is a very unlikely matter.

                     <p>O! the Scripture is plain! he died the day before the Seventh day Sabbath.

                     <p>¶ 1) <hi>Adam</hi> was a glorious piece of Gods creation:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall.</note> his Soul and Body was an Epitomy of Heaven and Earth: and an houſe for God to inhabit. To ſay <hi>Adam</hi> fell on the Sixth day, is to liken God his Maker to a fooliſh Builder:

                     <p>¶ 2) It ſeems by Sacred Scripture, that neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor Angels fell on the Sixth day: for in the concluſion of the Creation, at the Cloſe of the Sixth day, <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good: and the evening and the morning were the Sixth day</hi>

(4) Satan is very buſie with Saints on Sabbath dayes. He tempts them to work, and buy, and ſell, when the Sabbath is begun in the Evening. To lay in Bed in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                     <p>I have read in learned Authors,<note place="margin">The R<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Bp of—for One.</note> that the two dayes which bounded the feaſt of 7 weeks, viz, the firſt day and the 50 day, fell (that year) both on the firſt day of the week. That the firſt day of the 50 followed the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Sabbath, is as clear as the Sun<note n="†" place="margin">Lev. 23.11, 15.</note>: ſeeing <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe on that firſt day, and lay dead on the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106434:134"/>7 day, and died the day before; its alſo as clear as the Sun, that he died on the 6 day. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ſaith my Author, The reſurrection was Tipified to be on the firſt day of the 50 by the Wave-Sheaf (of firſt fruits) which was a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Type of Chriſts reſurrection on that day, who was waved before the Lord by the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake at his riſing that morning, and called <hi>the firſt fruits</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note>. And the 50 day, that famous Pentecoſt, was Sealed for a New Sabbath by the gift of the holy Ghoſt to the Apoſtles: by vertue of which, 3000 ſouls<note n="†" place="margin">Act 2.41.</note> were converted as firſt fruits to God and the Lamb.] And this Harmony hath been a Confirmation of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, viz, Chriſts death on the Sixth day, for many generations.</p>

                     <p>If ſo, its high time it was laid low.<note place="margin">I hope the beſt of that Bp: he was no horned Beaſt: but this his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inion I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not.</note> If I had no better foundation for my oppoſite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (I am not aſhamed to tell you) I ſhould be aſhamed to own it. This is ſuch another Proof as <hi>Adams</hi> fall was: and to as much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as the Story in the Greek Epigram: viz [Two deaf men pleaded a Cauſe before a deaf Judge.] But let us look on theſe 50 dayes,<note place="margin">The 50 dayes diſcuſſed.</note> in the letter of the Law. <hi>And ye ſhall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the Sheaf of the Wave-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 7 <hi>Sabbaths ſhall be complete: even unto the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath, ſhall ye num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 50 <hi>dayes</hi>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106434:135"/>the morrow after the ſeventh Sabbath is the fiftieth day (as the Greek word Pentecoſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies) <hi>and when the day of Pentecoſt was Fully come</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 2.1.</note>, i e, when the ſeventh Sabbath was paſt, the 7 weeks were complete, then the Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt was fully come. N B, The 50 day begins another week on the ſame day of the week that the firſt day of the 50 began the firſt week of the 7: ſo that the firſt day and 50 day fall both on the ſame day of the week. This a Child can tell, but I mind you of it (though a man) that you may ſee, your 2 great dayes for confirmation of your opinion, Stand and Fall together. And now I tell you, theſe 2 dayes did not fall on the firſt day of the week. Your famous Pentecoſt fell Not on the firſt day. But why do I talk? let us to work. That the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was killed on the 14 day, that the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Sabbath was on the 15 day on which <hi>Jeſus</hi> died, and that the Sheaf was waved on the 16 of <hi>Niſan;</hi> is as plain as A B C: by your rule, <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe from the dead the next day after his death: buried at Even, and roſe in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But ſuppoſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> had roſe on this Shake-ſheaf day<note n="†" place="margin">As your Author calls it.</note>, yet what Type of Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was this Sheaf? there was <hi>an he-lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 23.12.</note> offered on that day too, which was as much a Type of Chriſts Death on that day, as the Sheaf could be of his Reſurrection: by this rule <hi>Jeſus</hi> both died and roſe in a day: into what a wilderneſſe will the wit of man lead
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106434:135"/>us! N B, This wave-day (on which you ſay <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe) was the firſt day he lay in the grave: if your Author had ſaid, The lamb was a Type of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s death Before that day, and the wave-ſheaf a Type of his reſurrection After that day, there had been ſome ſhadow of Reaſon in his aſſertion. So you may ſee, that your Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt proof is periſhed: and your invincible Arguments, are overcome.</p>

                     <p>How many times hath God plainly expreſſed his mind in this matter! in the Law which <hi>Jeſus</hi> was under: viz, That the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſhould be killed the 14 day of the month: by your Own confeſſion, Chriſt was diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if he changed the day. N B, Suppoſe you could prove, <hi>Jeſus</hi> did Anticipate the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over and not ſin; and that the Jews kept the 15 day; yet except you prove the 15 day of the month to be the 7 day of the week, you neither prove <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe on the Wave-day, nor Pentecoſt on the firſt day, nor <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s death on the 6 day: and ſo you are never the near. But if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had brake any Sabbath, or Law of God in the Leaſt; he could not have been in the Leaſt, any Saviour<note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ja.</hi> 2.10.</note>. And that <hi>Jeſus</hi> failed in the leaſt <hi>Jota, Jod,</hi> Point, or Tittle; is folly, wickedneſſe, madneſſe in a man once to imagine. Before Chriſt would have broken any Command, he (upholding the whole Creation) would have let Heaven and Earth fall: for had he failed a Tittle of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole Law, Gods purpoſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106434:140"/>had fell. <hi>ERGO,</hi> this is an infallible <hi>Maxime,</hi>

                           <hi>A</hi> Maxime.</note> viz, On the 14 day of the firſt month <hi>Niſan,</hi> Chriſt killed the Paſſeover, <hi>according to All the Rites of it</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Nu. 9.3.</note>: and on the 15 day he was killed himſelf: the 16 and Wave-day, was the firſt day <hi>Jeſus</hi> lay dead, therefore he roſe not That day, nor could Pentecoſt fall on the firſt day. So your Pentecoſt opinion is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrown: and that for <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s death on the 6 day will follow: and you ſhall never recover them again while the World ſtands.</p>

                     <p>Nor was it proper for me out of the place: <hi>every thing beautifull in his time</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">Eccl. 3.11.</note>. I could eaſily have done that at firſt in few words: but the work was to Anſwer your Objections againſt my Judgment: and your Arguments for your Own. Having done that, I can ſhew my Opinion with pleaſure: but not with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better judgments, as ſome finely phraſe it. When I ſpeak my thoughts of what I am uncertain, it ſhall be with ſuch ſubmiſſion: but when I am well aſſured of the truth of what I ſay, I ſhall neither ſubmit to better nor worſe, to Stand or Fall, by this or that mans perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I deſire a better foundation, than mans Praiſe, for my Opinion. And what that is concerning the day of Chriſts death, I will now
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106434:140"/>declare: and were it to the whole World with your Self, I would declare it. viz,<note place="margin">Week-day of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</note> The 15 day of the firſt month <hi>Niſan,</hi> on which Christ was Crucified and Died, fell that year on the Fourth day of the week, i e, Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: at end of which Day our Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> was Buried: from which time to the end of the 7 day Sabbath, was 3 dayes and 3 nights,<note place="margin">N T proof.</note> the Term of time our Lord foretold he ſhould lay in the grave<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40.</note>. So there was two dayes between the day of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s death, and the 7 day Sabbath. And one day between that high Sabbath, and the 7 day Sabbath: had the Jews kept the right day, there had been two dayes between their high Sabbath, and the 7 day Sabbath: which you ſay were both on a day. The Reaſon of this Tranſlation,<note place="margin">Reaſon of tranſlation.</note> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it fell on Wedneſday: for if this Sabbath fixt on the 15 day, fell on Munday, Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or Fryday; the Jews Cuſtome was to tranſlate it to the next day,<note place="margin">Godwyn.</note> by the Rule 172 <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du.</hi> That year it fell on Wedneſday, they kept it on Thurſday, the 16 or Wave-day: ſo now you may ſee, your Wave-day and Pentecoſt were on Thruſday.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I ſhall deal ingeniouſly with you.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's way in his Work.</note> I have ſometime preached a Sermon for the obſervation of the Sabbath day. For a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I directed to the morning, ſuppoſing it to be the time of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s riſing. But I ſecretly thought I wanted a bottom: for I could not tell
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106434:145"/>what time in the morning <hi>Jeſus</hi> roſe: and was as if my heart did not ſtand by me in it. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel now in what Miſt I was groping at Noon day, for the time of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s riſing in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for that was not at all to be expected. Nor need the time of his reſurrection be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, when the time of his Burial, viz, Even, and the time of continuance in the Grave, viz, 3 dayes and 3 nights are both expreſſed. The ſhame of this Bottomleſſe counſel for a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath, I am willing to bear: but I knew no better: yet my ignorance will not excuſe my negligence, I ſhould have made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Search. But I was never concerned about it till you and I had talked under the Tree: ſince that I have been much perſwaded, that the Common count for the day of Chriſts death was not True: but that he lay longer dead. And becauſe I had never diſcourſed any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, I ſearched ſome Expoſitors of Texts relating to it: and found them all oppoſite to me: ſo I ſee, if I went on, I muſt go againſt the Stream. And ſeeing I could find nothing For me, I ſought to find all I could Againſt me: and to know the Full ſtrength of this Stream. This being found, I laid theſe learned Authors By, and fell to work by the ſearch of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Prayer: for I could not give it over. And though many a time after Much ſtudy and Little hope, I have been Cruſhed as if I ſhould give up the ghoſt; yet I could Not give it
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106434:145"/>over: but continued in prayer to God, viz, that if the Common count of the day of Chriſts death was true, he would cauſe me to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in it: but if my perſwaſion was true, that he would be pleaſed to help me to underſtand it, and make it out to You, and not leave me to erre in it. To this purpoſe I did implore God with many prayers, and many t—, to ſay no more, <hi>he knows the way I take</hi>

And I pray conſider ſeriouſly with your ſelf, what account you will give at the Great Day, if you will not hear Gods voice ſo Audible, nor ſee his word ſo Viſible: but will bottom your Sabbatical opinion on mans Tradition, which hath no ground in Gods word.</p>

                     <p>¶ 5) Be ſpiritual in every duty on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.<note place="margin">5 Direct.</note> In order to This, be ſpiritual on Other dayes.
